# MEAN STACK IMPLEMENTATION
A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. Here we will implement a **MEAN** stack which consits of:

 **M**ongoDB - No-SQL database (Document database) <br>
 **E**xpressJS - A server side Web Application framework for Node.js <br>
 **A**ngularÂ - Front-end application framework to handle Client and Server Requests <br>
 **N**ode.js - A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

 For our example  application, we are adding book records to MongoDB that contain book name ISBN number, Author, and number of pages

Technologies/Tools used:
* AWS (EC2)
* Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
* MonogDB
* ExpressJS
* Angular
* Node.js
* GitBash
